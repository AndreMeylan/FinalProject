# Diabetes Risk Prediction on AWS

## Project Overview

This project focuses on addressing a significant healthcare concern: the early identification of diabetes risk. Given the substantial direct healthcare costs associated with diabetic patients, which account for a considerable portion of the Spanish National Health System expenditure, there's an urgent need to mitigate the prevalence of this condition. Our solution leverages AWS services to deploy a machine learning model capable of predicting an individual's risk of developing diabetes based on various physical health indicators. This early detection system aims to facilitate prompt lifestyle adjustments and interventions, potentially reducing the financial and health burden of diabetes.

## Problem Statement

Diabetic patients incur high direct healthcare costs, significantly impacting the Spanish National Health System's budget. Early detection of diabetes risk states and subsequent lifestyle modifications can dramatically reduce the incidence of this condition. Our goal is to deploy a predictive model that identifies individuals at risk of developing diabetes, thus alleviating the economic strain on healthcare systems.
